# Ethereum Price Prediction

### Motivation 
<p> As an economics student, I became fascinated with the idea of arbitrage - exploits of short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms. By applying a prediction algorithm (albeit a simple one) to Ethereum, the world's most popular altcoin, I figured I might be able to purchase Ethereum from one exchange for a particular rate, and then selling it on another trading platform offering a higher rate, making a profit from the initial buy price.
