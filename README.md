# Ethereum Price Prediction

### Motivation 
<p> As an economics student, I became fascinated with the idea of arbitrage - exploits of short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or in different forms. By applying a prediction algorithm (albeit a simple one) to Ethereum, the world's most popular altcoin, I figured I might be able to purchase Ethereum from one exchange for a particular rate, and then selling it on another trading platform offering a higher rate, making a profit from the initial buy price.

### Objectives
- Conduct exploratory data analysis on the ETH dataset to prepare it for support vector regression.
- Perform support vector regression on the split (train and test) dataset.
- Create a plot to visualize the predicted and the actual values.

### Ideas for the Future
- Test my arbitrage strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance and profitability.
- Integrate with cryptocurrency exchange APIs to fetch real-time market data, place orders, and monitor account balances.
- Develop a monitoring system that tracks the performance of your arbitrage trades in real-time.
